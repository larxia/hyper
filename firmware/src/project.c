/* Projects: four slots. The slots live in .noinit RAM: they
 * survive resets and UBOOT entry. With FELUCCA_FLASH (default) every save
 * also goes to flash through storage.c, and an
 * empty RAM slot is filled from flash on load.
 *
 * Format 7 ("FUN7", written) stores P_COUNT (byte 66) and maps an older count as user presets do: FUN7 of
 * 89 parameters (before the chord keys P_CHRD / P_VOIC) loads its engine values at today's P_E0..P_E7,
 * the chord keys OFF / CLOSE, and its motion events' ids from its P_E0 on move up with them (proj_motion_ids).
 * 68 + 4 x (91 + 2 + 64 x 9) + chain + motion = 3040 of the 3372 bytes before the name: 332 spare, room for
 * 83 more track parameters (4 bytes each).
 * Format 6 ("FUN6") adds a 36-byte song chain before the checksum.
 * Format 5 ("FUN5", read only) = format 4 with the drum grid: a step is 10 bytes (step_t: its lane hits and
 * their accents after the 8 bytes it was), and each track has 40 reserved bytes (lane[8][5], written 0: room
 * for per-lane sounds of the DRUM engine). 4 ("FUN4": PROJ_NP_V4 parameters, the modulation matrix), 3
 * ("FUN3": PROJ_NP_V3, the SLICER), 2 ("FUN2") and 1 ("FUN1": PROJ_NP_V2) are read and converted, mapped by
 * count as user presets are (the first np - 8 are P_LEVEL.. in order, the last 8 P_E0..P_E7; the
 * parameters added since take their defaults: the SLICER OFF, every matrix slot OFF). Their steps get no
 * hits; on a DRUM track their notes that are a lane's note become its hits (proj_grid: the same notes and
 * velocities play, the grid shows them as its own).
 * Their engine bytes are kept: formats 1 and 2 had engines 0..7 (ANALOG .. WHEEL), and the engines
 * added since (SLICE 8, ..) were appended, no index moved.
 *
 * Track 4 was the GM drum part until 1.0 (no engine: its byte 0; its level and reverb send in the
 * globals G_DRLVL / G_DRREV, which are inert now). A project says which it has in `parts`: NPART
 * when written since, 0 before (a reserved byte, always written 0: the format and its size did not
 * change). proj_drums_to_part turns such a track 4 into a DRUM part with its default kit (the GM map, so
 * its drum steps still play drums; until 1.0.2 it was the SAMPLE engine's PERC set), keeping its steps, its
 * pattern and mix parameters (LEN DIV SWING GATE, PAN MUTE), its SLICER, and the drum level and reverb send
 * as LEVEL and REV.
 *
 * The byte `phys` (reserved, always 0, before 1.0) says what a PHYS track's MODEL means: 0 MODEL 2 was
 * DUST (dropped: it loads as MODAL bowed, eng_phys.c phys_legacy); 1 MODEL 4 was DRUM (the kit is the DRUM
 * engine since: such a track loads as DRUM, core.h drum_from_phys); 2 (PROJ_PHYS) as today. proj_phys.
 *
 * Format 8 ("FUN8", written since 1.0) = FUN7 with each track's FM6 patch (eng_fm6.c, the 128-byte packed
 * record, 4 x 128 bytes just before the name): a project is self-contained. On load an FM6 track's SLOT shows F n
 * when its patch is that factory one, else OWN (eng_fm6.c fm6_adopt; a stored 9..40, the B slots of the patch bank
 * before 1.0.3 or of 1.4.1's voice bank, is OWN too: the project has the patch).
 * It is 3584 bytes (FUN7: 3388); FUN7 is read (its tracks get the init patch). The retained cache (proj_slot,
 * .noinit) grew with it: after an update its slot 1 still starts with a FUN7 record, which is read; the other
 * slots fail their hash and come back from flash (persist_boot).
 *
 * Format 9 ("FUN9", written since 1.1) = FUN8 with 64 more bytes: the DRUM lane levels (P_LN0..P_LN7, #97) made
 * P_COUNT 99 (P_E0 91), and 68 + 4 x (99 + 2 + 576) + chain + motion = 3072 no longer fit before FUN8's patches
 * (3056). 3648 bytes, the patches at PROJ_FM6_OFF (3120): 48 spare, room for 12 more track parameters. FUN8 (3584,
 * its 91 parameters mapped by count: the lane levels 100 %) and FUN7 are read; the retained cache grew again (its
 * slot 1 still starts with the older record, read as above).
 *
 * Format 10 ("FUNA", written since 1.2; FUN10 in the docs) = FUN9 laid out the same way, 3840 bytes (a whole storage
 * object, storage.c ST_PAYLOAD_MAX), for four changes made together:
 *   - P_COUNT 104 (P_E0 96): LFO 2's SYNC TRIG POL, QUANTIZE and SPREAD (P_LSYNC .. P_SPRD) before the engine
 *     values. SPREAD (#148) came before FUN10's release, into the spare bytes below: a FUN10 of a 1.2 build before
 *     it holds 103 (byte 66) and loads by count (SPREAD 0, its engine values and their motion moved up by one);
 *   - 128 motion records (core.h MOTION_MAX, 64 before), 3 bytes each (place, id, the value as an int8_t: the values
 *     were always -64..127): the block is 4 + 384 = 388 bytes (FUN9's 260 held 64 of 4 bytes);
 *   - each step's NUDGE (core.h step_nudge, -8..+7) in bit 7 of its four note bytes (bit j in note j), bits every
 *     earlier format wrote 0: the step stays 9 bytes;
 *   - the song's sections (core.h chain_row_t): a slot per track (A..D or "-") and the repeats, 5 bytes a row: the
 *     chain is 4 + 16 x 5 = 84 bytes (FUN6..FUN9: 36, rows {slot, repeat}, chain_v9_t; they load as sections with the
 *     four tracks on the row's slot, song_chain.c chain_from_v9: the same song).
 * 68 + 4 x (104 + 2 + 576) + chain + motion = 3268; the patches at PROJ_FM6_OFF (3312): 44 spare, room for 11 more
 * track parameters. 1.5 took seven of them (no format change, FUN10 as it was): the INSERT (P_ITYPE .. P_IMIX, 96..100),
 * ANALOG's filter TYPE (P_FTYPE, 101) and ENV SYNC (P_ESYNC, 102), before the engine values (P_COUNT 111, P_E0 103; 16
 * spare, room for 4). A FUN10 of 1.2 .. 1.4 (104) loads by count: the INSERT OFF, TYPE LP, ENV SYNC OFF (as they
 * played), its engine values and their motion moved up by seven.
 * Firmware 1.2 .. 1.4 refuses a FUN10 of more parameters than its own (np > P_COUNT): a 1.5 project shows EMPTY there. FUN9 / FUN8 / FUN7 load as before (their 64 records of 4 bytes read by proj_motion_v9, every
 * step's nudge 0: the timing they always had; parameters mapped by count, the four new ones at their defaults:
 * SYNC OFF, TRIG NOTE, POL BI, QUANTIZE ON, SPREAD 0, which play as before 1.2), and so do FUN6..FUN1. Firmware before 1.2
 * refuses a FUN10 everywhere (its size and magic are no format it knows): a slot holding one shows EMPTY there (the
 * flash copy stays until that slot is saved over), a backup PUT of one is refused (rc 1), the retained RAM copy of
 * one fails its checks.
 *
 * Parameter locks (1.1, core.h MOTION_LOCK) are motion records with bit 7 of their id byte set (P_COUNT 99 < 128:
 * the bit is free): no byte moved for them, and every project before 1.1 has none. FUN9 holds them. A FUN8 / FUN7
 * record of a 1.1 development build may hold some: on load their ids move to today's positions as the others do,
 * the lock bit kept (proj_motion_ids). Firmware before 1.1 refuses a project that holds a lock (an id out of its
 * range), as with RATCH below; FUN9 it refuses anyway (a newer format).
 *
 * A step's RATCH (core.h SF_RATCH, the hits - 1, 0..3) is in bit 7 of its velocity byte (bit 0) and of its chance
 * byte (bit 1) of FUN7 / FUN8: bits every firmware before wrote 0, so every older project loads with its steps x1,
 * and no format or size changed. Firmware before RATCH refuses a project that holds a ratchet (those bytes out
 * of their range), as it would a newer format. FUN6..FUN1 have none (x1).
 *
 * DIGITAL (engine 1) was retired in 1.0 (fm4_convert.c): a track of it, in any format, loads as FM6 with the
 * patch converted from its values as the track's own (proj_fm4, on every import; the stored record keeps what it
 * holds until saved again). Its motion events on the EDIT or OP ENV values are dropped.
 *
 * SAMPLE's SET 4, PERC (the GM drum kit), was retired after 1.0.2: a SAMPLE track that selects it, in any
 * format, loads as the DRUM engine with its default kit (core.h drum_from_perc: the same GM key map, its steps
 * as they are, the rest of its sound kept; proj_perc, on every import as proj_fm4). Its motion events on the
 * EDIT values are dropped (SAMPLE's meanings, not DRUM's).
 *
 * Built on the Mac too (tests/project_test.c, -DPROJ_HOST): the part above the #ifndef
 * PROJ_HOST needs core.h, params.c (TP) and engines.c. */
