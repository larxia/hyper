/* Felucca quick layers: while a page button is held, the keys and KNOB 1..4
 * are its shortcuts and its map shows over the page. One table (LAYERS) drives the gesture, the keys, the knobs,
 * the LEDs and the overlay:
 *   FX   HOLD  the performance effects (perform.c) and the track mutes while held; KNOB 1..4 its macros. The white
 *              keys' effects are the user's (1.2): a white key held in the layer (FX held or locked) + PRESETS turned
 *              steps that key through NONE and the effects (it holds the new one at once), EDIT puts the key's default
 *              back; kept with the settings (fx_keys) when the layer closes
 *   GLO  SET   black keys 1..4 (F#3 G#3 A#3 C#4) T1..T4 MUTE (latched; lit = sounding), F3..B3 SOLO T1..T4 while
 *              held (HOLD cells, a corner triangle), C4 UNMUTE ALL, D4 MIDI LEARN on / off (1.5, midi_learn.c), E4 FILL
 *              while held (1.5.5, #209: the steps' FILL / !FILL conditions, seq.c seq_fill; HOLD), F4 TAP
 *              tempo; KNOB 1..4 T1..T4 LEVEL;
 *              GLO + PLAY: from the top without stopping
 *   SCL  SET   any key: its note name is ROOT; KNOB 1..4 ROOT SCL CHRD VOIC (LY_SCL: the SCL page's first two,
 *              the CHORD page's two; QNT TRN stay on SCL); the LEDs show the root lit and the scale's notes breathing
 *   EDIT SET   the white keys from F3: the engines in PRESETS order (one key each, the NENG_SHOWN one can pick:
 *              engines.c eng_vis), the next white key INIT (LY_INIT: E5), the next CLEAN INIT (LY_CLEAN: F5, 1.5.5)
 *              (the dialog); KNOB 1 ENG, 2 No. (the engine's sounds) (Dah: 3 FAV gone). Sound loads as on PRESETS: the steps
 *              stay, the editor gets RELOAD; they apply while playing too. 1.4.1: the black keys
 *              the selected track's engine's quick actions (EQA below: DRUM 1..8 its lanes' MUTE; other engines
 *              none yet, the keys dark)
 *   SEQ  SET   (1.2, on every page; up to 1.1.5 SEQ held opened SONG) (Dah) the selected track's QUANTIZE and CLEAR
 *              ALL (ui_tools.c): the PRESETS knob the QUANTIZE amount, OCT+ APPLY; F3 CLEAR ALL (its dialog); KNOB 1..4
 *              LEN DIV SWING GATE (the PATTERN page's up to 1.1.5)
 *   REC  SET   (1.1.5, on every page; REC's tap still arms / disarms) the white keys from F3: CLEAR (the selected
 *              track's steps and automation, no dialog), CLICK (OFF REC ON), COUNT-IN (OFF 1 BAR
 *              2 BARS), CLICK LEVEL (LOW MID HIGH), each press the next value; KNOB 1..3 the same three. The settings
 *              are MENU > AUDIO's (ui.c rp_get / rp_put: one store), saved when the layer closes. Replaces the old REC held on SEQ (Discussion #91:
 *              the CLEAR Tn SEQUENCE? dialog and its "HOLD: CLEAR" hint)
 * The gesture: let go before HOLD (the menu: 0.3 .. 0.6 s) with nothing else touched: a tap, the button's page.
 * Held past HOLD alone: the map (a peek), letting go does nothing. A key, a knob or a button meanwhile: a combo,
 * the map at once, no tap. Keys pressed with the button down are the layer's (seq.c keyboard_block): silent, no
 * MIDI, never recorded; keys held before stay notes. Only one layer at a time: a second layer button is ignored.
 * PLAY and REC work in every layer (GLO held + PLAY: RESTART; GLO's lock: PLAY as always, #183); SAVE, HOME, SEQ and
 * the other page buttons are swallowed. In SET layers OCT± do not shift the octave (OCT- held: RESET SETTINGS in GLO
 * REC SEQ, layer_reset). A HOLD key's effect lasts until the key is let go, the map with
 * it. No layer in the menu, a dialog, NAME or the UPDATE MODE countdown. After a tap, until the layer has been opened
 * once: "HOLD [GLO] QUICK" (the seen bits are kept with the settings, favorites.c spare byte).
 * The lock (Discussion #83): a double tap (the second press within LY_DTAP_MS of the first tap, both let go before
 * HOLD, nothing else touched) opens the map and keeps it open with no button held (ui.lock): ly_down() counts the lock
 * as the button held, so the keys (seq.c keyboard_block: kb_lock), KNOB 1..4, OCT- act exactly as held (PLAY starts
 * and stops: GLO's RESTART needs GLO held, layer_play). A tap of its button closes it (the press hands it back to the
 * button: held on, a peek; let go, closed; never a tap), so do another page button, HOME, SAVE, SEQ (each then acts as
 * always), the menu, a dialog, NAME. The first tap is not deferred (a single tap opens its page at once, no lag): it
 * opens the page and remembers the page it left (lys.nv); the second tap locks the layer over that page, put back, so
 * a double tap leaves the page as it was. A first tap that acted instead of opening a page (EDIT on STEP: clear the
 * step; on USER / PROJECT: rename) arms no double tap: two quick taps there still act twice. */
