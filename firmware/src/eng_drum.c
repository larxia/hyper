/* DRUM: a drum kit of 8 lanes (drum_voice.c, Felucca's own): KICK, SNARE, CLAP, HAT CL, HAT OP, TOM, RIM,
 * BELL. Before 1.0 it was PHYS's MODEL DRUM; projects and user presets saved then load as this engine
 * (drum_from_phys in core.h).
 *
 * Keys and notes: the keys play the General MIDI drum map with the kick on the first C (C KICK, C# RIM,
 * D SNARE, D# CLAP, F# HAT CL, A# HAT OP, F G A B C D TOMS, C# CYM, G# BELL; OCT -/+ move it), and a note
 * plays its GM drum (35..81: kicks, snares, toms, hats, cymbals, bells, congas, claves; other notes as
 * their octave of 36..47), so GM patterns and MIDI parts play as they did on SAMPLE PERC (retired: its sounds
 * load as this engine, core.h drum_from_perc).
 *
 * Parameters: KIT the kit: STD (Felucca's own: TOM RIM BELL on lanes 6..8, other GM notes their congas, claves,
 * cymbals) or a model kit (80 10 66 55 77, 1.5.6 DEEP TIGHT PERC: every lane that kit's own piece, drum_voice.c DV_KIT; KICK does not
 * apply). Its stored values 1..3 were HAND CYM H+CYM (STD with CONGA CLAVE / CYM on lanes 6..8) until 1.0.4: they
 * play 66 10 77 now (DK_PLAYS), and whatever stores them lands there (params.c enum_orig, param_fit: the knob
 * steps over them, the editor's SET, projects, user presets, motion). KICK the kick (PUNCH, ROUND). TUNE (64: as
 * designed, +-12 semitones), TONE, DECY and SNAP (each lane's extra: the kick's drive, the snare's snappiness,
 * the clap's spread, the hats' noise, the toms' bend, the rim's drive, the bell's strike) move every lane from its designed value. ACC
 * is the accent at full velocity (velocity scales it), DRV a soft clip on every hit (x1..x4, level kept).
 * Each lane has its LEVEL (P_LN0..P_LN7, EDIT > LANES / LANES 2, #97: square law, 100 % the kit as designed, the
 * default, so every older sound plays as it did), on the voice amplitude after the knee (a quieter lane is cleaner).
 * A hit keeps the drum and the variant it was struck with; the knobs move it while it rings.
 *
 * Polyphony: a lane per drum and part, mono: a hit reuses its lane's voice even at another pitch, the 8 lanes ring
 * together. A sounding voice plays one lane (s[0]); the lane remembers its voice (owner), and a voice
 * whose lane was struck again by another voice, or has rung out (-84 dB), ends itself (drum_amp). The
 * voices come from the shared budget (voice.c), up to 8 per part. A closed hat chokes the open one.
 *
 * What applies (engine_t.oneshot): the hit is the envelope. VOICE (always POLY), GLIDE, the ADSR, ENV DEST,
 * LFO DEST PIT / FLT / SHP and the global TUNE do nothing; LEVEL, PAN, the sends, DIST, the SLICER,
 * LFO DEST AMP, velocity and E1..E8 (the knobs) do. A released key does not end a hit.
 *
 * State: 8 lanes per part in the part's engine memory (engines.c eng_mem; drum_kit_of: the parameters, coefficients, voice and metal
 * source of each lane). */

 * has no use for it), so projects, user presets (up_fm6.c) and the editor's backup carry them as they are:
 * field n = lane x DL_NF + f at byte n / 11 x 21 + n % 11 of the 155-byte voice (an operator's rates, levels and
 * breakpoints: bytes the FM6 formats keep whole up to 99), marked by the name DL_SIG. A patch without the mark: every
 * lane at its default (the kit as it was). Loading a factory DRUM sound clears them (eng_fm6.c drum_track_loaded).
 *   VOICE  0 KIT (the kit's own piece), 1..DVT_COUNT one of Felucca's own drums, then the model kits' pieces (kit by
 *          kit, lane by lane: "80 BD" .. "PERC CB"), then (phase 2) SYN 1..5: the layered voice (drum_voice.c
 *          DVT_SYNTH) playing that layer set (below; lanes may share one, each with its own TUNE DECAY TONE SNAP)
 *   TUNE   semitones, DL_DEF 24 = 0 (-24..+24, held in the drum's range)
 *   DECAY TONE SNAP  50 = as the kit and the EDIT knobs make it; each step 64 / 50 of the knob's (-64..+63)
 *   STACK  0 OFF, 1..8: a hit on this lane strikes that lane too (voice.c trk_note_on; one level, never itself)
 * The layer sets (phase 2, EDIT > SYN TONE .. SYN METAL, ui_drumlane.c): DS_NSET = 5 sets of DS_NF = 17 values in the
 * same voice, each value a whole byte inside the range the FM6 formats keep (fm6_max: what fm6_pack, fm6_unpack and
 * fm6_sanitize leave as it is), so nothing is packed and a set needs no format either. The bytes free after the
 * lanes' 48 (0..10 21..31 42..52 63..73 84..87) and the name (145..154, DL_SIG):
 *   up to 99   op 4's 88..94, op 5's 105..115, every operator's OL (16 + 21 k) and FF (19 + 21 k), the pitch
 *              envelope 126..133, the LFO's 137..140: 42 bytes
 *   smaller    per operator FC 0..31, DET 0..14, RS KVS 0..7, LC RC AMS 0..3, MODE 0..1; ALG 0..31 (134), TRNSP 0..48
 *              (144); FB LPMS 0..7, LFW 0..5, OKS LKS 0..1 (unused)
 * Set k (0..4) takes operator k's ten smaller bytes and OL FF, six of the pool's 30, and one of five for SWEEP (its 15
 * values: op 5's FC DET, ALG, TRNSP, 140): DS_AT. 8 of the 17 need more than 32 values (the levels, PITCH CUT BEND, the
 * noise's and the metal's decays) and 40 of the 42 bytes go to them; so five sets, not eight (an open and a closed
 * hat share one: their lanes' DECAY apart). Marked by 139 = 83 and 119 (op 5's AMS) = 2: a patch with lanes of before
 * (its bytes there whatever the FM6 voice had) reads SYN 1..5 as DV_SYN_DEF until the first write (eng_fm6.c dl_set)
